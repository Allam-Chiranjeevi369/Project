Using Face Recognition As Attendance System.
This system focuses on building a face recognition-based attendance monitoring system for educational institutions to improve and upgrade their current attendance system. The current old system has a lot of ambiguity that caused inaccurate and inefficient of attendance taking. The technology working behind will be the face recognition system. The human face is one of the natural traits that can uniquely identify an individual. Face  recognition utilizes  facial features  for  security purposes. The  classification  method  is K-Nearest  Neighbor (KNN).  The K-Nearest  Neighbor algorithm  uses neighborhood  classification  as the  predictive value of a good instance value. K-NN includes an instance-based learning group.
